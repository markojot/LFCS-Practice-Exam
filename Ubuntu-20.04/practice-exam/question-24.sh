# Identifying the difference between files and directories is a common system administrator task
#
#   1. Find which files in /usr/diff/ is different and write the file name to a file /usr/diff/answer1 
#   2. Find all of the files that are in /usr/diff/diff1 but not in /usr/diff/diff2 and write them to /usr/diff/answer2
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# check for any output
diff file1 file2

# there is likly a way to do this with a quick bash script; however with <tab> autocomplete I find this to be easy enough
diff file1 file3

# repeat until you get an output
diff file1 file4

# this quickly writes file4 to the answer file 
echo "file4" > /usr/diff/answer1 

# this will list all the files in either directory but not both
diff /usr/diff/diff1 /usr/diff/diff2 

# writes the first different file to answer2 file
echo "file1" > /usr/diff/answer2

# appends the second different file to answer2 file
echo "file2" >> /usr/diff/answer2
